				<b>Manchester United are back, says Red Devils legend Roy Keane.</b>
				<p>
					The Red Devils have been scoring for fun in both the Premier League and Champions League, with Romelu Lukaku particularly catching Keane’s eye with his great impact since joining in the summer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Keane played for some of United’s most dominant sides under Sir Alex Ferguson, so knows a thing or two about what it takes to win football’s most prestigious honours. Despite a difficult few years for the club since Ferguson’s retirement in 2013, their former skipper is now expecting big things from them again this term.

				<b>Ex-Manchester United chairman insists Alan Shearer said he 'wanted to go to Man Utd'</b>
				<p>
					Former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards insists that Alan Shearer told Sir Alex Ferguson he wanted to join the Red Devils.
					Shearer left Blackburn Rovers in the wake of Euro 1996, but it was hometown club Newcastle United he moved to, rather than Old Trafford.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pogba only joined the Red Devils last summer for what was then a world-record £89million, and was starting to show his true potential after taking time to fully adjust to the Premier League. However, United now fear Pogba’s injury could be worse than initially expected as they weigh up whether or not the 24-year-old should undergo surgery.
				</p>

				<p>
					Meanwhile, Edwards has also discussed the Red Devils almost signing another Geordie legend.
					He said: “
					Obviously people talk about Gascoigne.
					“We nearly had him, we thought we got him and in the end he went to Tottenham.”
